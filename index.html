            The new(ish) rotational item machine gun bow is broken beyond belief. I once had a

        <h2 class="post-title">The match against KingDogo</h2>
        <p>
          When I was around 200 stars, KingDogo started grinding. He was extremely active and equally good. I queued him twice.
          The first was an unmemorable loss. It was a very close match: neck and neck. I broke his bed and had him at his 
          base with way better gear. But he was sneaky, so slippery such good players
          are. He mined a wool block on his island with shears and managed to escape. In the end it was a battle of kb sticks.
          I was on him with pots I had almost won. I got knocked off into the void...

        <h2 class="post-title">The match against GreenJedia04</h2>
        <p>
          I think I was in my ruby prestige. The map was Apollo. I didn't realize he was in the game until it was only us left. 
          I distinctly remember that we had the same bed defense of wool endstone. When bed trading, I went through mid and got 
          the em advantage. After that, it was a matter of potting on him. I won the game. I remember I was a little annoying afterwards.
          Not toxic or anything but I tried to friend him and I messaged him cuz I was nicked. Cringe behavior ngl.

        <p>
          I was on my brother's account because I didn't want to prestige. Iirc, I was just on the verge of 600 stars. I queued him on Apollo.
          I remember I played like a complete jerk. Cornering him and waiting patiently, knowing there would be another player rushing him and 
          he would have to yield to me. He survived quite long but I ended up killing him. I remember I felt so proud. Of course he tied the score
          in a much later match on my main. That was also when he invited me to the solo guild.

        <h2 class="post-title">The match against Lueigi</h2>
        <p>
          When I first played him I was in the 400's (I think?). It was a game on Solace. Back then, he was named fortnitekid2013. I recognized the name
          from the Hystats leaderboard and got pretty scared. I played patiently and tried my best but he had a huge gear advantage and he 
          was noticably better at the time of our game. Needless to say, I lost. Much later, he was my first rush on Airshow. I played super annoyingly and 
          got him. Oh also I played him once on Apollo waaay before and I plancked him and was so surprised by his stats. I didn't fight him that game through
          so it doesn't count.

        <h2 class="post-title">Matches against Aluaxis</h2>
        <p>
          Aluaxis was super nice to me and to my knowledge, one of the solo players I have played the most. In our early matches I had a distinctly positive
          score against her. However, she got really cracked. I remember we did a set of private matches and the disparity in pvp skill was emberassing. I queued
          her a few more times after that but I lost them. I don't know my exact score against her but I would be very surprised if it wasn't in the negatives.
          The first time I played was in both of our ruby prestige on Skyrise. Her lb spot has skyrocketed since then.

        <h2 class="post-title">The match against Awshee</h2>
        <p>
          I played Awshee twice in the same day. This was during a time when I was quite good yet she was definitely better. Both times were on Deadwood. I 
          think I got her bed first both times. The first time she ended up clutching. The second time, I played super annoying and chased her down, finally killing 
          her. Unfortunately I lost that game to a semi-rando: a diamond prestige above average player called ItsLenerix. I can't believe I threw that game 
          after beating a top 10 solos player...
